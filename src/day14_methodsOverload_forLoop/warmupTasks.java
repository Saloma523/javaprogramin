Warmup Tasks:
	Task1:
	    Create a method named combine that can take two string and hen add them together and returns it.

	        combine("one", "eight")  ==> oneight

	Task 2:
	    1. create a method that can find the sum of two integer numbers
	                method name: sumOf2Numbers

	    2. create a method that can find the sum of three integer numbers
	                method name: sumOf3Numbers

	    3. create a method that can find the sum of four integer numbers
	                method name: sumOf4Numbers
