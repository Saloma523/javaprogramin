/*

    2. Create a class named NumberOfDays. An integer variable named month is given
        Use switch statement to write a program that can find the number of days in the given number of month.

                EX:
                    month = 5

                output:
                    31 days

                (Assume that February has 28 days)

            Hints:
            	Months that has 31 days: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12
                Months that has 30 days: 4, 6, 9, 11
